# MLP Neural Network

MLP Neural Network is a lightweight Python library for building and training Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models. This repository provides a simple yet powerful framework for experimenting with neural networks, along with an example program and dataset to help you get started quickly.

## Features

* Simple API: Quickly build and train neural network models with a few lines of code.
* Customizable Architecture: Easily configure the number of layers, neurons per layer, activation functions,  learning rates, epochs, batch size and threshold.
* Example Program: The included "test.py" script demonstrates how to integrate and use the library in a real-world scenario.
* Sample Dataset: Comes with an iris.csv file containing the famous Iris dataset, ideal for testing and learning.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

* Python 3.x is required.
* NumPy library is required.
* Pandas library is required.
* Json (built-in) library is required.

Install NumPy python library by using the below.
```
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
```

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/ThePhantom2307/MLP-Neural-Network.git
cd MLP-Neural-Network
```

Or you can use the built-in function pip
```
pip install NeuralNetworkMLP
```

## Running the Example
The repository includes an example script (test.py) that shows how to use the library. The script loads the provided iris.csv dataset, builds an MLP model, trains it, and evaluates its performance. To run the example, simply execute:

```python
python test.py
```
## Usage
You can incorporate the MLP Neural Network library into your own projects. Below is a short example to illustrate how to use the library:

```python
# Import the neural network class
import NeuralNetworkMLP as nn
import numpy as np

# Load or create the datasets
X_train = np.array([[0, 1],
           [1, 0],
           [1, 1],
           [0, 0]])

y_train = np.array([[1], [1], [0], [0]])

X_test = np.array([[1, 0]])

# Define your network architecture: for example, input layer of size 2, one hidden layer with 10 neurons, and output layer of size 1.
neural_network = nn.NeuralNetwork(
        input_layer_neurons=2,
        hidden_layers_neurons=[10],
        output_layer_neurons=1,
        activation_functions=[nn.RELU, nn.SIGMOID]
    )

# Train the model on your training data (X_train and y_train should be defined appropriately)
neural_network.train(X_train, y_train)

# Predict on new data
predictions = neural_network.predict(X_test)

# Save the model
neural_network.save_model("NeuralNetworkModel.json")

# Load the model
neural_network.load_model("NeuralNetworkModel.json")
```
For more detailed usage, refer to the test.py file, which provides a complete example.
